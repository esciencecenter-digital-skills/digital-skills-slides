## Collaborative version control with Git and GitHub
This workshop introduces version control with Git and teaches you how to collaborate using Git and GitHub.

Knowing how to use Git and GitHub will allow you to keep track of changes in your software project, publish your code online, collaborate with several people in the same project, and contribute to projects as an external collaborator.
